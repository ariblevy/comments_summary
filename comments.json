I'm in my 30s and I didn't know I prefer eggs 3x boiled.","Yummmmmmmmm\n\nHow long do I leave them in cold water for??","Do you need to change water after each boil? I ask because if the water is hot, kettle will turn off sooner in second and third boil compared to first boil because of the temperature of water","Me who eats the first one without toast bc i like to have boiled eggs as a snack🥲👍🏽","Wait is the first one cold or normal? Or can it just be whatever","Can you say the timess","The first one, not only it is delicious and perfect as is---t is also the healthiest with less oxidation.

Best cheap Breakfast.\n\nSecond one, I like to have with Maggi or any other Instant Noodles/Ramen. It complements the food perfectly.\n\nThe Third One, well, Just season it and Eat it!
